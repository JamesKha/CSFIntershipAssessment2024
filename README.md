1. Discuss how the application and API could be extended and improved:

One way to improve the application is by implementing a feature to handle spelling errors in city names. Another enhancement could involve retrieving data from Google's reviews and nearby locations to provide users with information about restaurants or other places of interest. However, due to limited Google API credits, this feature may not be feasible at the moment.

2. Discuss how the application and API should be deployed:

It is crucial to ensure continuous connectivity between the database, whether SQLite or MongoDB, and the API. While the application may have been hosted locally during development, it should be deployed to a suitable server environment such as AWS or DigitalOcean for production. These platforms offer scalability, reliability, and security, which are essential for a production environment.
